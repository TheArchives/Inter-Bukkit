Inter-Bukkit
============

This is the bukkit plugin to go with my [Inter project](https://github.com/gdude2002/Inter).

Please note that Inter is very old and somewhat crappy. This is a rewritten version of the plugin that's been running
at The Archives for quite some time now, which adds support for custom tokens in chat and various other things.

Want to build? `gradle shadowJar`.
